To compile:
1. open terminal
2. run command "make"

To run:
1. create and start virtual machines.
2. run job on virtual machines.
3. open terminal.
4. run command "./memory_coordinator <period(s)>"
5. see that free memory on each of the virtual machines is almost the same. 

Algorithm:
The algorithm balances free memory in each of the virtual machine. In each run of the memmory_coordinator it does the following:
1. Determine the unused memory and actual memory in each VM.
2. Find the Average unused memory in each VM.
3. Set the new memory in each VM equal to sum of it used memory and average free memory found in step 2.
	3.1. Used memory in each VM = actual memory - unused memory
	3.2. New memory in each VM = used memory + average unused memory.
	3.3. Round new memory to the closet multiple of 1024.
4. Allocated memory is reclaimed by host if the least wastage in more than 20%. In other words, if the least ratio of unused and actual memory is more than 20%, the host reclaims the memory such that least wastage is set to 20%.
