To compile:
1. open terminal
2. run command "make"

To run:
1. create and start virtual machines.
2. run jobs on virtual machines.
3. open terminal.
4. run command "./vcpu_scheduler <period(s)>"
5. see that load on physical cpus are balanced. 

Algorithm:
The algorithm balances load across all pcups. In each run of the vcpu_scheduler, it does the following:
1. Determine load on each vcpu and each pcpu.
2. Use these stats to balance load across pcpus. To balance:
	2.1. Sort vcpu load in decending order.
	2.2. Create a min-heap of pcpu load.
	2.3. Iterate over the sorted list of vcpu load and assign it to pcup with the minimum load (returned from min-heap).
	2.4. Upadte load of this (2.3) pcpu by adding this (2.3) vcup load.
	2.5. Update the heap.
3. This algorithm is not optimal allocation, solving for optimal allocation is np-complete problem (set-partition for equal workload division).
4. But the algo gives very good results in  practice by allocating maximum loaded vcpu to minimum loaded pcpu in each iteration.
