1. First, make sure you already installed gRPC and its dependent `Protocol Buffers v3.0`, check out [Install Dependency](INSTALL.md)
section to find out much more details.
2. Compile code and generate libraries
    - Goto src directory and run `make` command, two libraries would be created in external directory: `libmapreduce.a` and `libmr_worker.a`.
 
        ```bash
            cd src && make
        ```

    - Now goto test directory and run `make` command, two binaries would be created: `mrdemo` and `mr_worker`.

        ```bash
            cd test && make
        ```

3. **Now running the demo, once you have created all the binaries and libraries.**
    - Clear the files if any in the output directory

        ```bash
            rm test/output/*
        ```

    - Start all the worker processes in the following fashion:

        ```bash
            ./mr_worker localhost:50051 & ./mr_worker localhost:50052 & ./mr_worker localhost:50053 & ./mr_worker localhost:50054 & ./mr_worker localhost:50055 & ./mr_worker localhost:50056;
        ```

    - Then start your main map reduce process: `./mrdemo`

        ```bash
            ./mrdemo
        ```

    - Once the ./mrdemo finishes, kill all the worker proccesses you started.
        1. For Mac OS X:

            ```bash
                killall mr_worker
            ```

        2. For Linux:

            ```bash
                killall mr_worker
            ```

    - Check output directory to see if you have the correct results(obviously once you have done the proper implementation of your library

        ```
